# General Assembly Project 0
## TicTacToe
This was an enjoyable little project. See a demo of my TicTacToe game [here](https://jyeharry.github.io/project0/).

Despite how simple TicTacToe is, this game took some serious head scratching to fully implement.

I'm very certain that I'll come back to this project in the future and scoff at how poorly written it is, but looking at bad code and knowing how I can improve it is one of the things I love about coding.

## Technologies Used
This project was written in HTML, CSS and jQuery 3.5.1

## Technical Requirements
- Render a game board in the browser
- Switch turns between X and O (or whichever markers you select)
- Visually display which side won if a player gets three in a row or show a draw/"catâ€™s game" if neither wins
- Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files
- Stick with KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles (not actually sure how I went with this step...)
- Use Javascript for DOM manipulation
- Deploy your game online, where the rest of the world can access it
- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

## Extra Features
- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter
- Allow players to customise their tokens (X, O, name, picture, etc)
- Get inventive with your styling, e.g. use hover effects or animations to spiff things up
