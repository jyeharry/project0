## TicTacToe
See a demo of my TicTacToe game [here]().

This was an enjoyable little project. Despite how simple TicTacToe is, this game took some serious head scratching to fully implement.

I'm very certain that I'll come back to this project in the future and scoff at how poorly I approached it, but looking at bad code and knowing how I can improve it is one of the things I love about coding in general.
